# ðŸ“° Practice Challenge - News Portal

This project was developed as part of the **Rocketseat course**, with the goal of practicing and enhancing my knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**.

## **ðŸ’¡ About the Project**
The **News Portal** is a simple application for displaying news, focused on practicing page structuring and styling using HTML5 and CSS3. This project **did not involve responsiveness**, as it was aimed solely at creating a static page.

## **ðŸš€ Objective**
- Practice using **HTML5** to create the structure of the portal.
- Practice **CSS3** for styling the interface, including layout, colors, and fonts.

## **ðŸ“š Course Information**
This project is part of a **paid Rocketseat course**. I have access to it, but **I cannot share the Figma**, as the project belongs to the course and sharing it would violate copyright.

**News Portal** was a great opportunity to strengthen my HTML and CSS skills.
